## Ansible Playbooks

Ansible is an automation tool that allows for the remote execution of commands and the management of multiple remote systems. For CageLab, it is used to manage the remote cagelab nodes, to ensure software is up-to-date and consistent across devices. You will need to edit the inventory/hosts file to add or remove nodes from the inventory. The playbooks are located in the playbooks directory and can be run using the ansible-playbook command.
